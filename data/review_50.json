There is a lot more bad about this game that I can't be bothered describing, but there is one final thing i want to mention. I have not beaten it yet, and this is because I died, then my game crashed, and now whenever i load my save the game just crashes. Dont play this, just replay half life instead.\n\nUPDATE: I've now beaten the game and it was very terrible, first of all i was told that i needed to disarm a nuke, which i did, but its so easy you just walk up to a car where it is and then click it, then was the final boss fight, which i hoped would be cool, but it was just some tentacle rip off (it literally has one of the tentacles horns on it) and there wasnt even any music for this fight, or any clear way of knowing what to do, you just shoot its eyes, fight a shocktooper, and then repeat that until the boss fight ends, also another part i wan to touch on is the blast pit remake, where its a giant worm instead of tentacles, that literally it, except to blow it up you have to activate valve and gearbox (haha such a funny

It was ok\n\nI recently played Half-Life Opposing Force, which I started right after playing Half-Life's \"remake\" - Black Mesa. It was exciting to revisit the Black Mesa facility and experience the story from a fresh perspective, especially after the immersive army training at the beginning. The first few chapters were enjoyable, even though the graphics and physics were not as impressive as in Black Mesa.\n\nHappiness didn't last very long. Bugs and AI stupidness occupied my gameplay - I got stuck in walls a hell of times, and AI teammates tried to kill me a lot because of some glitchy behaviour. It became so frustrating that I had to force myself to finish the game. But by the end of the game, the gameplay became much more enjoyable, and I am not sure why. There were fewer bugs, and the final boss Gene Worm (nice guy), was a thrilling challenge.\n\nOverall, I found the Opposing Force DLC to be overly tedious and less engaging compared to the main game and Blue Force. While I would recommend it to hardcore fans of Half-Life, I wouldn't suggest it to more casual players like myself. Skipping this DLC in 2023 won't take anything away from your overall Half-Life experience.\n\nUPD: After this review and retrospective view of Blue Shift, I remembered in detail the new mechanics and bosses that Opposing Force introduced.

The big additions are new aliens, more guns, and squad tactics. Fight your way through different parts of the base, with a few familiar sites, and deal with the invasion on a different front. \nI\u2019ve always wondered if this was a retcon, where the military suddenly isn\u2019t an antagonist. The plot seems to try to direct it as such, shifting blame despite the events of the base game itself. \nstill, onwards.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] No Xen levels. Beyond a few brief sequences the game is blissfully short of Xen, which is a terrible positive, but it\u2019s still a positive. \n[*] The game feels decidedly Half-Life. It feels put together with the same care and attention to detail as the first, but suffers the same flaws because of it. For its time, though, it made it a strong expansion.\n[*] The new enemies and weapons all feel different and provide a new experience, expanding on the ideas of the base game. They feel well placed, and the only question that pops into my mind is \u2018Where were they?\u2019 Which is a standard issue when trying to fit an expansion inside the very same space as the original.  \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] Saves are bugged, mouse is bugged, game crashes, and when things are running \u2018smoothly\u2019, they aren\u2019t smooth. The game has issues performing at every step and it\u2019s as frustrating as it sounds.\n[*] Friendly fire, isn\u2019t. The clinging to realism, where American soldiers spend more time shooting their allies than enemies, is laudable, but a bit on the chin. It was when one of my squaddies lobbed a grenade directly into the cluster of his team mates, who were in cover and not even in the same direction as the aliens, killing all of them, that I just decided to stop bringing the soldiers along. It improved my battle performance no end. \n[*] The extra weapons led to bloat for me, where I found myself cycling through all the menus looking for the gun I wanted. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]\n [list][*] FIX. THE.

Opposing Force is a drab, lifeless mod that tries to stuff far too many ideas in to a small amount of play time. In general it feels like amateurs made it and indulged themselves whilst doing it. I'd avoid, as it's not very engaging to play, and play other games/HL mods instead. e.g. Go play 'Echoes' or 'They Hunger'.\n\nIn full:\n\nWhen I played this in my yoot, I loved it. Half-Life was amazing, this was more HL, therefore it was amazing. Though looking back I barely remember anything other than the nightvision and the machine gun. I don't even remember the bosses. Could that be because it's simply been 20 years?\n\nWell, now as I play it, 20 years on, I see how flawed asnd forgettable it is. Playing it on the back of HL1 it feels completely amatuerish. I've played _a lot_ of HL mods and TCs over the years, both single- and multi-player, and this really pales in comparison to a lot of them.\n\nThe mod is completely uninspired. It relies mainly on taking familiar places, set-pieces, weapons and enemies from HL, giving them a slight twist, and then repackaging them for you. However they didn't understand the ethos Valve had when making Half-Life, and this is clear from just the training room, e.g. you're forced to listen to huge amount of cliche drill sergeant chatter, whereas the original HL hazard course practically allowed you to speed run the entire thing. \n\n\nIt's clear when playing Half-Life that a huge amount of love and attention went into each level, making every area feel alive and like a \"real\" place, and a large amount of testing went in to make the subtle cues that direct the player's flow state work like magic. We'd come to know such polish as a hallmark of Valve. \n\nNo such care has been taken with the majority of the levels in this game. OP4 simply does not have the je ne sais quoi of Half-life. The vast majority of the levels are boring, square boxes with the wrong footsteps sounds applied to them and ZERO atmospheric sounds applied. You spend the vast majority of the game clumping around listening to that classic \"half-life concrete footstep\" sounds. It rarely tries to drop those timely music tracks that HL performed so well just before a battle or something interesting. Most of the major \"set piece\" battles were a thrill to take-part in in HL, whereas in OP4 they're just boring shooting galleries. \n\nGearbox also often made that rookie HL mapper mistake of trying to make large open areas, which doesn't work well with HL's BSP tree engine, as it will happily bring a modern computer to it's knees if you give it an open enough arena. So I imagine that's why all of those open arenas are so square and boring -- they were desperate trying to go \"big\" whilst also saving on brushes and portals. Valve knew HL's limitations and allowed them to guide the level design, but I guess Gearbox's short turnaround time on making the game meant they lacked any such experience, and it's obviously something the HL community had yet to learn by the time of OP4's release.\n\nBut even ignoring the engine problems Gearbox show a general lack of experience in designing fun experiences. In general OP4 makes the mistake of adding \"more more more\" without any tact or sense on how to apply that. It's completely misguided and leaves everything feeling crowded. A good example is it adds a large number of weapons and keeps the majority of the old ones. You have fully stocked roster. But you have so many that you can barely use them all before completing the game, and it makes managing battles with HL's inventory a pain as now you have 2 more categories and each category has a million weapons. \n\nThey clearly had more ideas than production budget when developing this mod and it's a classic example of scope creep.\n\nOther short examples of Gearbox's eyes being bigger than their belly: \n\n* \"Let's have them play the soldier!\" Cool. But you completely forget to address the whole \"shooting civilians\" thing. Why is Shepherd nice but the ones we see in HL will happily shoot everything?\n\n* The rope system. You use it like, twice in the entire game. It's a colossal waste of development time and the player's time learning it. It also looks stupid.\n\n* The squad system is fun, but rarely serves any functional purpose.\n\n* The portal gun is beyond useless. It effectively converts 40 uranium into a few health packs or batteries. But after the 5th or so Xen map it starts to recycle them and doesn't even repopulate the spawns, meaning the portal gun's second fire stops being useful 1/3 of the way through the game! But those Xen levels are clearly loaded into each main map, as the portal is instant with no loading, which presumably also contributed to the memory pressure and hence their more drab main environments. The Xen levels themselves are also drab, flat and empty, I assume for the same reason. There's very little Xen flora or fauna when compared to stock Xen.\n\n* Also the Xen levels have the wrong gravity? You don't float as much. \n\n* It added a nightvision mode, in lieu of the flashlight, but it's ugly and useless and the times when it IS requires are really tedious.\n\n* The monsters and weapons themselves are fun, however. Except the two melee weapons. Why add a knife AND a wrench? Especially as the wrench is redundant -- the knife does a better job at killing monsters AND at smashing boxes. There's no need for the wrench. It's just wasteful bloat. But I think they needed to cut most of the original weapons to allow their new ones to shine. \n\n* There were quite a lot of jumping and environmental puzzles. I quite liked them, but they weren't paced well with the combat, so they often felt tedious, and they all took place in those drab boxy environments. They also over-use box-smashing.\n\n* Too much gman, ruining his mystique. \n\nIt's kind of ironic that OP4 adds lots of stuff to HL, but rarely did it add anything worth remembering even 1 hour after playing it, let alone 20 years.", "timestamp_created": 1683754566, "timestamp_updated": 1685444456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473032265901565552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137900364": {"recommendationid": "137900364", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064483991", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1684237531}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0442\u044b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u044f\u043a\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a-\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 1 \u0445\u0430\u043b\u0444\u043b\u0430\u0439\u0444\u043e\u043c \u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0447\u0451\u043d\u044b\u0445?", "timestamp_created": 1683400339, "timestamp_updated": 1683400339, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470756053924560547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137870024": {"recommendationid": "137870024", "author": {"steamid": "76561199144157093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1674945761}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend bought me this game but...Not really my style TBH\nIf you like first person shooters that also feel nostalgic then you can try it out.", "timestamp_created": 1683361288, "timestamp_updated": 1683361288, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137863887": {"recommendationid": "137863887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340470745", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1683347683}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly I wish I could like this game but I can't. here are all my nit picks. 1: most of the new weapons suck. the barnacle gun is almost useless outside doing a few mandatory grapples. The BFG is just kinda disappointing all you do is travel to some random ass place i xen and get maybe a med-kit and a few shotgun shells, and its attack is also just boring.  the shock roach is like the hive hand but it doesn't track the enemy.  The sniper rifle is just kind of a meh, when i tired playing i would hit the black ops and they would just keep charging at me. The wrench is cool, and actually a really go idea for a melee, but its weighed down by the fact that there are 2 melee weapons. The Saw and desert eagle are fine and are actually a decent inclusion. 2: Most of the enemies are annoying to fight, the pit drones, shock troopers, vortigore, black ops + the bosses. 3: Level design. Now to opposing forces credit when it gets a level right, it gets it right, but most of the time you're fighting your way through a sewer, storage building, storage yard, or a generator room of some kind. all of these places look the same and are boring the few maps that were actually cool were gone in like 3 minutes because they were low to no combat. Also why the hell are there so many elevators in this, within the first 4 chapters you like gotta use 10 elevators and its always like a little platform with a button. 4: Community Praise.

Opposing force has some fun weapons and is a neat side story to the original Half-Life that is fun for the first few hours.\n \nAfter about the halfway point there isn't a single enemy encounter that isn't incredibly annoying with either way too many enemies thrown at you, too many overpowered enemies in one spot or just generally not giving you enough health pickups. All the difficulty feels either unfair or artificially induced from going to fights few little HP.\n\nWhile the new weapons are fun, they're incredibly situational and mostly not as fun as what was in base HL. Also many seem to overlap in function far too much with other weapons in the game or are not distinct enough from the weapons they replaced from base HL. Overall the weapon sandbox feels a little confused and poorly thought out.\n\nOnly two of the new enemy types are remotely fun to fight, with the more fun of the two being hardly utilized. The others put the base game's most obnoxious foes to shame by a mile\n\nTo top it off the final boss is (admittedly far less annoying than base HL's) incredibly lame and far too easy\n\nIf you are in a pinch and desperate for more Half-life I suppose it would do, it's not awful.

Gearbox Software and Valve Software are credited as co-creators of the game, but the game does not live up to the quality level set by the original Half-Life, or even the Half-Life expansion Half-Life: Blue-Shift of which I am a big fan. You reach a point in the game where you are fighting against are very strong aliens who don\u2019t die easily, and you can\u2019t even replenish your ammunition. Also during these moments, health pick-ups are rare. You\u2019re facing marines more powerful than you. You pour bullets into them, but they\u2019re still standing and shooting you. Though it seems alright at the start, the expansion pack really isn\u2019t worth loading.\n\nWhile the original Half-Life had serious puzzle solving, there is basically one puzzle in this game, though it was fun to solve. The final boss is neat, although amazingly, the game will not finish with OpenGL graphics selected. I was playing on Linux, and switched to the Windows machine to see the ending because the end of the game just doesn\u2019t happen on Linux. I would have expected much better bug testing for such a high-profile franchise. Surely they could have made a patch?\n\nAlso disappointing are the lack of good music tracks. The original Half-Life was ahead of its time with quality techno / electronica, but I remember only one half-decent track, and that was all. Graphics are on par with the original, as you would expect.\n\nThis is my least favorite Half-Life.", "timestamp_created": 1679879865, "timestamp_updated": 1679879865, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559901952743530273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135310459": {"recommendationid": "135310459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189188082", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1679918529}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Cl\u00e1ssico que valeria a pena jogar se por um erro que a steam apagasse meu save local e da nuvem.

Very poor sense of atmosphere.\n\n2. \"Puzzles\" are both cryptic and mind-numbing: often-times the solution to clearing a room is simply waiting for a scripted event to finish.\n\n3. Horrible jump vertical: you need to crouch-jump to overcome a milk carton. Surely a soldier is more athletic than this?

While I understand the game is a product of its time, I found the original Half Life to be far more enjoyable than this expansion. \n\nFor a game that positions the player as the HECU sent in to drive back the Alien incursion and to silence the Science team, you do very little to embrace the \"opposing force\" role. If anything, the vast majority of the games events are skipped as you're unconscious for most of it. You're just a survivor who has to contend with very annoying enemy design and worthless marine allies. Only this time without any of the intrigue that built up to the battle of Xen. I did not like most of the new additions to the Aliens, especially the Shock Troopers. (and their bargain bin headcrabs) Damage dealt to them felt disproportionate at times. Sometimes you would one bang them, others would take entire magazines before going down, at which point they will likely have nailed you a few times despite blasting them to pieces.\n\nAs for the level design, while I definitely enjoyed some of the claustrophobic environmental hazard segments, the level design at times felt very unintuitive. Certain gaps in walls don't look like you can squeeze through when you actually can despite having failed several times. Lighting in the levels sometimes have this awful issue where you cannot see regardless of whether you have Night Vision on or off. My favourite part was when I soft locked my game on EVERY SINGLE LIFT! Not sure why this bug exists, but for some reason you will get glued to the floor and unable to break free whenever a lift stops and reaches its destination, unless you bunny hop. Ridiculous bug that should have been patched years ago.\n\nAs for the story, its not very interesting and has never since been brought up by future instalments.", "timestamp_created": 1674187360, "timestamp_updated": 1674187360, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131054118": {"recommendationid": "131054118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165275663", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 469, "last_played": 1577936803}, "language": "latam", "review": "Lo \u00fanico bueno son las armas.

Endless praise of it's design, mechanics, story; purely 9-10/10 reviews, wherever I went that had Half-Life discussion, Opposing Force was sure to be mentioned. I was led to believe there really was a reason for the high-and-mighty acclaim. The cream of the crop, Goldsrc Half life at it's peak.\nAlas, after a full playthrough (on hard difficulty), I do not see what makes this game be held in such high regard. I ended up dissapointed, so much so I longed for it to end soon by around 3/4ths of the game. This game's shortcomings ended up preventing me from having as much fun as I anticipated going in. By no means is it a truly awful game, nor simply bad, though the game felt like a convoluted mess of ideas that could have been thought out better. I would still recommend the game to fans of Half life, though I'd advise them not to expect absolutely too much.\n1. Adrian himself\nLets discuss Adrian Shepard, the franchise's tacti-cool protagonist who was seen once and never again.\nWhile several interactions throughout the game characterize him as a valiant leader and a hardy fighter, I feel that he falls short of what makes the other protagonists so interesting.\nWhat I feel made Gordon and Barney feel special in comparison to the typical FPS protagonist of the time, was their rise to action. Both of them pre-incident happened to just be some Joe-Schmo's working at their regular boring job, who later happened to be the right man in the wrong place. They didn't have much combat or leadership experience at all; their rise to heroism was made up of pure improvisation. \nThat's not the case for Shepard however, who falls into the general trope of the stranded super-soldier, much akin to the likes of Doom Guy or Master Chief. Shepard is objectively a cool figure and a formidable face, yet he pales in comparison to what made the other 2 HL1 protagonists intriguing, by expanding their motive and their connection to the environment. Doom guy's in this game, neat, but it doesn't add much...\nPlaying as an HECU soldier, you'd expect right from the get-go to engage in combat with Black Mesa facility and even attempt to exchange fire with Freeman himself...\nThe game has none of that. The most you'll see is the radio operator making his speech to pull the troops out (coinciding the end of Surface Tension in HL1), and right after a soldier pushing one of the scientists. Adrian along with all of the other soldiers haven't recieved any orders, even any elaboration as to why they were there in the first place. This just feels like a missed opportunity to characterize Shepard and his fellow men, and the story could have been enhanced by adding in a moral dilema whether or not to follow orders or spare the innocent lives of the Black Mesa personel. What could have made you truly feel like the \"Opposing Force\" is entirely left out, which I feel hurts the game's story.\n2. Weapons\nOne of the major factors that I see this game get praised for the most (and what I've inversely seen as a common criticism of Blue Shift) is the \"NEW WEAPONS! WOWZA!!\"\nThe game features a majority of HL1's arsenal (barring the Tau Cannon and Gluon gun), along with a new wide variety of new toys to play with.\nThe thing is with these, I feel that the game added too many new weapons for its own good. Let's go over the new arsenal featured in game:\nI did quite enjoy the pipe wrench, charging up shots to instantly gib many lower-level enemies is satisfying, and it's viable throughout the entirety of the game. A good addition.\nThe combat knife sounds interesting on paper, given it's pretty much a reskin of the crowbar, while stabbing a human enemy from behind will instantly kill them. I'm a fan of backstab mechanics in games such as TF2 and Counter Strike, yet, in this game I couldn't name a single instance where it would be more practical to sneak up on an enemy from behind (which is quite difficult to achieve in the first place), rather than just shoot at them with your primary firearm.\nThe Desert Eagle is a sweet upgrade over the already stellar colt revolver, this was my most used weapon throughout the game.\nThe following weapons however, are where I feel things get iffy.\nThe barnacle grappling hook is ridiculous and funny as hell, though from the time you get it up to the game's end, it feels underutilized, only a tool you need to use thrice, and not much other than a headcrab killer (funny how theres no headcrab appearances after it's introduction).\nThe machine gun was neat, sure. It's like the SMG but actually combat-viable. I didnt find it too satisfying to use though, not like how people make it out to be...\nShock roach is basically this game's equivalent to the hivehand, not much to say about it.\nI couldn't name one instance where I decided \"Hmm, spore launcher sounds like a good weapon choice!\" Every time I used it was just to get it out of my inventory.\nThe sniper rifle was a good mirror to the crossbow, though my gripe is that it felt too powerful, considering bodyshots would instantly kill any Black Ops. Granted, it did get me through Foxtrot Uniform to Worlds Collide, but I feel that it's an unbalanced weapon.\nDisplacer cannon was one of the opportunies I felt was most missed out on. Primary fire deletes enemies, simple as. It's the weapon of choice for any interaction with Voltigores. Secondary fire just feels like an insult however. It's introduction in \"We are not alone\" would lead you to believe it's foreshadowing the importance of Xen later on in the game, and I anticipated to explore both Black Mesa and Xen across every chapter. No, Xen in this game just serves as a place to trade uranium for health and ammo (which is still appreciated, considering how stingy the game often gets with resources). What could have been a fun tool to switch up your action ends up leaving a lame impression.\nBut the overwhelming arsenal featured in this game just ends up being tedious to work around, with weapon switching becoming a pain the farther you progress later in the game, and many of your armaments just become obsolete. The game could have used less item bloat, benefitting from a neater inventory of weapons that are done well and are practically usable. The high amount of poorly executed ideas ends up dampening the overall experience.\n3. Enemies:\nSomethings up with the game once you start actively dreading combat of any sort. \nThe problem with the Black Ops units is the map design that makes them tedious to fight at times, with several instances of you being  weakened regardless of your state before. I disliked the inclusion of assassins as regular enemies. In Half-Life, they appeared a grand total of 2 times, but both those encounters felt engaging and had you thinking ahead, cautiously coming up with ways to outsmart them. In Opposing Force they just end up being annoying as HELL. \nAnd the RACE X ALIENS, god damn, pretty much NONE of them are fun to fight against. Their inclusion just feels both goofy and frustrating. Plus the final boss ended up being comically easy and anticlimatic. race x is lame lmao\n\nConclusion:\nLooking back, damn I really lambasted this game. I genuinely do feel that alot of the issues this game end up detracting from what couldve been a absolutely magnificient expansion. I notice alot of slander against Blue Shift due to it being a generally less ambitious and very short game; but I believe that with the few things that  Blue Shift did, it did them right. This is what causes Opposing Force to suffer for me the most, the lack of development and reinforcement in alot of the design and gameplay elements prevent the game from shining as bright as it could. It still is a fun game, just not at all what I've been led to expect from hearing the Half Life fanbase.\n\nAh also, Paul Blart's in this game, hell yeah he's a real homie.", "timestamp_created": 1673413299, "timestamp_updated": 1673413299, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130348561": {"recommendationid": "130348561", "author": {"steamid": "76561199021496383", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 630, "last_played": 1695566937}, "language": "english", "review": "enemy placement is terrible, i walk into a room and 5 shock troopers teleport behind me. then when ive killed those another 6 spawn in front of me. theres way to many weapons although they are cool, the added monsters are ass ( like a giant yellow maggot chasing me down a sewer wtf?)

"review": "Although boasting some good new weapons and creature designs, Opposing Force mostly feels like a less-iconic and less well-executed version of the original Half-Life, which means it struggles to hold up well more than two decades after its release.\n\nVersion played: Steam, played on Steam Deck\nPlay time: 10 hours\nGameplay: 45/100\nStory: 25/100\nGraphics and Design: 70/100\nAudio: 75/100\nFun factor: 60/100\nReplay value: 20/100\n\nOverall grade: 63/100\n\nPros / Cons Summary\n\nPros\n\u2022 (Gameplay) The weaponry is better than in the original game. There's a sniper rifle!\n\u2022 (Gameplay) Many gameplay elements are repeated in a lesser form from the original Half-Life, but the original was so good that the results are still OK.\n\u2022 (Graphics and Design) The new creatures are few but they're generally well-designed.\n\u2022 (Graphics and Design) There are a couple of cool visual moments.\n\nCons\n\n\u2022 (Story) There's no story at all here, other than that you're a marine and are working your way through Black Mesa. The environmental storytelling of the original game is almost entirely absent.\n\u2022 (Gameplay) The AI is dismal when viewed through a modern lens.\n\u2022 (Gameplay) The AI enemies feel cheap. \n\u2022 (Gameplay) It's unnecessarily difficult. Get ready to save and load a lot.\n\u2022 (Gameplay) Some new movement types fall flat, especially the ropes.\n\u2022 (Graphics and Design) The level design is pretty boring.\n\u2022 (Graphics and Design) The game is a little too enamored of night vision, and this seems to have impacted the amount of effort the developers put into properly lighting many areas.\n\nSteam Deck notes: I played it docked in 4k while connected to my TV. There wasn't so much as a hitch. I used a standard Xbox Wireless Controller and a slightly modified version of the default control scheme (I like to put the screenshot key on the 'capture button' and I messed with the right stick sensitivity curve).

Although it is not awful, it is not as good as everyone seems to make it out to be. Constant bugs getting stuck on things or not moving after an elevator. The number of times I had to reload a save just to continue the game was staggering. The enemies felt more like cannon fodder shoehorned in to pad out the time and make it difficult. The levels felt oddly planned out and didn't make sense. I understand how hard it would be to follow up Half-Life but my god this was not good. I also understand the time it was made as well, but the polish Half-Life had shown the problems with this game are not because of technological limitations but mishandling the IP. Also two weapons for melee? Small nitpick but this didn't make any sense. Lastly, why was the G-Man so prevalent? In Half-Life you barely saw him if you were paying attention, but he is always around for some reason. Yes, we get he is important but less is more.

Unfortunately, it is not lacking in shortcomings too.\n\nLevel-design is nowhere near as good as in Half-Life and it seems to constantly recycle concepts from it, but with a different monster or a modified layout along with a significant degradation in quality and pacing. There was also at least an instance where enemy spawns were placed right in front of a loading trigger, making it easy to accidentally walk through it while fighting them.\nSome of the new weapons were fun to mess around with, but in general they seem to have been added just for the sake of it and are either rarely ever needed or overlap each other in functionality too much. The nonstop fights against the same enemy types also made some sections tedious to get through, especially in the second half of the game. In addition, dialogue felt like I was watching a mockbuster of Half-Life, with G-Man feeling particularly out of character. The depiction of HECU soldiers is also very whitewashed when compared to the original.\n\nFunctionality-wise it doesn't seem to have aged very well, becoming quite apparent in the final quarter of the game.

En uno de los primeros cap\u00edtulos del juego, estaba rompiendo unas cajas para ver si encontraba suministros. Por supuesto, para no tardar tanto, manten\u00eda pulsado el boton de ''disparo'' con la llave inglesa. \u00bfQu\u00e9 puede salir mal? Pues el hecho de que, en una de esas cajas, hab\u00eda un lanzacohetes, y claro, en estos juegos, cuando coges un arma nueva, se selecciona autom\u00e1ticamente. El resultado es que el pobre Shepard se lanz\u00f3 accidentalmente un cohete en la cara. Aqu\u00ed el problema no es que me suicidara de una forma tan tonta. Aqu\u00ed la pregunta es: \u00bfQu\u00e9 sentido tiene que, en una etapa tan temprana del juego te den un arma tan poderosa como un lanzacohetes?\nLa guinda sobre el pastel llega en el cap\u00edtulo de Fuego Aliado. En este cap\u00edtulo, llego a un lugar donde se encuentra un m\u00e9dico, adem\u00e1s de unos Black Ops, que resisten una cantidad rid\u00edculamente alta de balas, pero bueno. Resulta ser que, por alguna extra\u00f1a raz\u00f3n, el m\u00e9dico, al rato, me ataca sin que yo le haya atacado a \u00e9l. L\u00f3gicamente intento defenderme, pero si le mato, el juego me tira una pantalla de Game Over.

but after a while it got boring.\n\nGenerally I just sort of remained either frustrated with this game, or disappointed with it because I got bored after a while.\n\nIn some cases the path to progress were also fairly cryptic or outright frustrating to play through.\n\nThere's some platforming in some Xen areas near the half of the game, those got fairly annoying because of how \"floaty\" my character felt, at times it would be as if the developers had just deliberately placed the platforms just far enough for you to fell as soon as you ALMOST reached the edge.\n\nCrouch jumping didn't help.\n\nThen there was this part near the end where I just didn't know where to go next, this games are fairly linear for the most part, but here I couldn't for the life of me; find the freaking pathway to progress.\n\nEventually I did, turns out I had to jump through the broken window of one such elevator, something that I don't think I've ever had to do in any other Half Life game, even in the first game where you have to do a similar thing, you do it by slamming the window pane of the elevator door that's closest to the ground, and the game gives you a ton of hints in its design to let you know this is what you're supposed to do, it even places the crowbar right next to that elevator door.\n\nOverall I just thought it was a cool concept for a game, specially a Half Life game, given that you're playing from the perspective of one of the soldiers that gets to Black Mesa facility; sadly it didn't pay off at the end though, I couldn't bring myself to even finish it.", "timestamp_created": 1639406570, "timestamp_updated": 1639406570, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522634208202362061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105408479": {"recommendationid": "105408479", "author": {"steamid": "76561199202496025", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1648479200}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e00\u8fdb\u53bb\u5c31\u9ed1\u5c4f\n", "timestamp_created": 1638885495, "timestamp_updated": 1638885495, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495578080415725708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105387703": {"recommendationid": "105387703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149281891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1638846886}, "language": "english", "review": "The new alien enemies SUCK.

Pas\u00e1rselo se siente como un trabajo.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]La exploraci\u00f3n es buena. Muchos niveles tienen varias salas interconectadas entre s\u00ed. Si pones atenci\u00f3n, puedes encontrar lugares con objetos para recoger.\n\n[*]Los sonidos de los enemigos que se oyen a por el mapa funcionan genial para a\u00f1adir tensi\u00f3n.\n\n[*]Hay armas nuevas respecto al juego original.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Contras:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]El manejo del personaje es mal\u00edsimo. Se mueve demasiado r\u00e1pido para los espacios tan cerrados en los que tiene lugar la acci\u00f3n. No puedes apuntar bien mientras te mueves en espacios tan peque\u00f1os y a distancias tan cortas. Pero si no te mueves r\u00e1pido, te acribillan. Y el personaje tambi\u00e9n se desliza al frenar. A eso a\u00f1ade que hay sitios en los que tienes que saltar de altura en altura. Y, si te caes, pierdes un buen pedazo de vida.\n\n[*]Los combates con enemigos son muy tediosos. Se mueven muy r\u00e1pido, y te acribillan muy f\u00e1cilmente. Sobretodo, cuando aparecen en tu cara nada m\u00e1s abres una puerta. Aunque no te maten, te quitan m\u00e1s vida de lo que te puedes permitir a largo plazo, para enfrentar los siguientes encuentros. As\u00ed que tienes que recargar y repetir casi siempre.\n\n[*]Los soldados vienen corriendo hasta tu cara y te disparan en la cara mientras te echan granadas.\n\n[*]El jefe final es mal\u00edsimo. Tras pasarte el juego matando alien\u00edgenas a base de pegar tiros con distintas armas, al jefe final tienes matarlo dispar\u00e1ndole en dos puntos puntos del cuerpo diferentes, con un par de armas especiales que hay colocadas en dos sitios distintos de la sala. Cuando le disparas en los dos sitios, abre un punto d\u00e9bil al que tienes que seguir disparando para matarle. Tras unos segundos, esconde el punto d\u00e9bil, y a repetir. Toda la pelea final consiste en repetir ese proceso varias veces seguidas. Entre iteraciones, hace emerger a un \u00fanico soldado alien\u00edgena normal y corriente de los que has matado a decenas. Por una parte, se agradece que sea f\u00e1cil. Porque, a esas alturas del juego, s\u00f3lo tienes ganas de terminarlo cuanto antes y olvidarte ya de \u00e9l. Pero es que, adem\u00e1s de f\u00e1cil, es soso. No se siente como pelear contra un jefe. Se siente como pasarte 10 minutos dando vueltas por una sala para tocar el mismo par de botones muchas veces. Lo \u00fanico que se siente como una pelea es matar al enemigo que emerge entre iteraciones. Y eso, al mismo tiempo, se siente como simple relleno. Muy cutre todo.\n\n[*]Para pasar una parte tienes que activar una visi\u00f3n nocturna de la que no te hablan en ning\u00fan lado.\n\n[*]Con algunas armas, la mirilla se te fija autom\u00e1ticamente sobre los enemigos al pasarla cerca de ellos. Hace que apuntar a veces sea dif\u00edcil.\n\n[*]La mirilla de algunas armas a veces ni se ve. Especialmente con la visi\u00f3n nocturna. Tanto la mirilla como el filtro de visi\u00f3n nocturna son de color verde. Cuesta apuntar.\n\n[*]Errores:\n[list]\n[*]Algunas puertas funcionan mal. Aunque se puedan abrir, no siempre se abren al darle al bot\u00f3n. Te tienes que acercar y alejar para que se abran. A veces, tienes que hacer eso en varias ocasiones, porque tampoco funciona siempre. En ocasiones, esto pasa mientras hay enemigos que te disparan al otro lado de la puerta, para mejorar las cosas.\n\n[*]El juego est\u00e1 a doblado a castellano a medias. Algunos personajes hablan en ingles. Otros en castellano. Otros dicen algunas frases en un idioma, y otras frases en el otro.\n\n[*]En un nivel, se me empezaron a corromper las partidas guardadas a partir de cierto punto. Al cargar y repetir esa parte, dej\u00f3 de pasar. Pero podr\u00eda haber perdido todo el progreso.\n\n[*]No consigo jugar directamente al juego en Steam. Me dice que lo est\u00e1 ejecutando, pero no arranca. He tenido que instalar el [i]Hal-Life[/i] original, abrirlo, y cambiar de juego desde su men\u00fa principal.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1634922472, "timestamp_updated": 1634986929, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101346993": {"recommendationid": "101346993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050237511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 177, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1634225146}, "language": "latam", "review": "No aporta nada sustancial a la trama.

Game is supposed to be fps but its traumatizing, you hear it right. Playing this game should be considered self harm at least for me it was. I had really bad times with those scary fish in half life one but it was amazing game so i enjoyed the rest where they werent. But this expansion is something else. Gearbox messed up they turned tactical shooter into horror. Okay so do you remember those Xen monsters? They were pretty cool but then Gearbox came and said. \"We throw original monsters away and introduce new terrifying ones that will run against you or throw stuff but mainly run against you to make you scared\" Yup they introduced race X what is really bad concept to throw bunch of nobodies in established lore. But those monsters will scare you for your life, iam not making this up, game is unplayable because they are often placing them behind edges to jumpscare you, but the sewers are big no go they just said: \"You know what?

Am anfang macht das ganze noch Spa\u00df man m\u00f6chte dem Black Mesa Vorfall aus der dritten Perspektive sehen, die level sind interessant und man erlebt wie alles sich entfaltet und was in anderen Bereichen passiert. Die Steuerung und das ganze Gameplay ist zwar Alt aber es geht noch gut von der Hand manchmal ist es einfach gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig aber halb so wild.\n\nIn der Mitte des Spiels merk man leichte Erm\u00fcdungs Erscheinungen aber das ist ok soweit da man denkt gleich muss noch was kommen also der H\u00f6hepunkt zum Abschluss, leider wird man entt\u00e4uscht das Endgame ist voll von Gegnern zwar viel aushalten aber daf\u00fcr dann auch viel schaden machen zum ausgleich kriegt man aber dann nur wenig Medkits und Aufladungen f\u00fcr seine R\u00fcstung und nicht viel Munition f\u00fcr die entsprechenden Waffen mit denen das alles einfacher gehen w\u00fcrde.\n\nEs ist sehr Frustrierend wenn viele starke Ausserirdische und Blackops Soldaten einem vor die linse geworfen werden und dann das halbe Arsenal wertlos ist da es nicht genug schaden macht. Dann hilft auch nicht die wertlose Schrotflinte f\u00fcr die ich absolut keinen Nutzen gefunden habe.\n\nWas cool ist, ist das man seine Kameraden mitnehmen kann und so in der Theorie, Kampff\u00e4hige Verb\u00fcndete hat, oft sterben diese aber schnell und, wie ich gemerkt habe, sind die an engen Stellen nicht hilfreich und schie\u00dfen in den R\u00fccken weil vor dir ein Gegner ist, das macht es dann auch nicht einfacher. Nachdem ich (wie ich kurz sp\u00e4ter dann feststellte) kurz vor dem ende war, wo das spiel schon seit 2 Std wenig bis keinen Spa\u00df mehr machte, dann Cheats aktivierte um das ganze endlich zu ende zu bringen, merkte ich es w\u00e4re nicht besser geworden. Der Endkampf war dann nicht wirklich gut.\n\n\nZum End Kampf:\n[spoiler] Man hat vor sich ein riesiges Tentakelmonster, man soll die beiden Augen auf Augen h\u00f6he mit stion\u00e4ren  Laserwaffen beschie\u00dfen damit dann die Mitte des Monsters aufgeht um dann dort schaden zu machen, das ganze dann 4 mal und fertig, zwischen durch werden dann die leider immernoch gleichen Gegner gespawnt was das ganze jetzt nicht besser macht.[/spoiler]\n\nDem spiel ist zu gute zu halten das es einige interessante Alien Waffen gibt die man nutzen darf, was aber trotzdem seltsam ist da man im Hauptspiel als Wissenschaftler nicht solch exotische Ausr\u00fcstung bekommt, man ist ein Marine der einfach wei\u00df wie das ganze Funktioniert. (?!?!???)\n\nFazit: Lass da lieber die finger von, es f\u00e4ngt zwar gut an aber es wird sehr langweilig und eint\u00f6nig zur zweiten h\u00e4lfte.", "timestamp_created": 1613646891, "timestamp_updated": 1613685372, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491071432828903198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86900696": {"recommendationid": "86900696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198886665271", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1303, "last_played": 1648736189}, "language": "english", "review": "dont play this, skip to half life 2 lol", "timestamp_created": 1613587730, "timestamp_updated": 1613587730, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86712692": {"recommendationid": "86712692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435140979", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 590, "playtime_at_review": 874, "last_played": 1699999341}, "language": "turkish", "review": "s\u0131k\u0131c\u0131 normal hl 1 daha \u0131y\u0131", "timestamp_created": 1613394246, "timestamp_updated": 1613394246, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86431400": {"recommendationid": "86431400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405015905", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1613089977}, "language": "latam", "review": "3.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1613090008, "timestamp_updated": 1613090008, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86301476": {"recommendationid": "86301476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018249687", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1668472424}, "language": "english", "review": "i can t trne laft or riet", "timestamp_created": 1612914868, "timestamp_updated": 1612914868, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477544039487838745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86235638": {"recommendationid": "86235638", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983169374", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2211, "last_played": 1645450936}, "language": "german", "review": "startet ja nicht", "timestamp_created": 1612829057, "timestamp_updated": 1612829057, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86044259": {"recommendationid": "86044259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990292702", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1692555373}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a shame that the bugs I encounter keep from playing the game.

The game itself has some really good ideas but the mess of bugs that just get you stuck is painful, I've gotten stuck in elevators, walls, even once in the floor. Loading a quicksave can also crash your game from time to time.\n\n\nSome parts of the game are also massively frustrating thanks to very rare health and suit refilling opportunities and the resilience of some enemies, there are parts where this feeling is especially present thanks to the stupid amount of enemy spawned in a tiny area, enemies that have a gigantic amount of health in some cases. While battling the enemies in this game you will probably die, a lot, and you will need to respawn, the problem is that many of the autosave points are in areas that will make you repeat a boring vent or a puzzle you've already completed and have to repeat, this issue can of course be avoided by quicksaving, but as mentioned before, it likes to sometimes crash the game. Another problem I think is important is how weapons are handled, there are a lot of new weapons but most of them won't actually get much ammo during the game.\n\nOverall, it's not the worst of games but it does seem like no one play tested it due to the amount of bugs and frustrating instances during the time you spend playing.\n\nAlso, Otis stops being used fairly soon and he's so much better than the marines, unlike the marines Otis won't actually shoot you in the back while fighting.

I think the original Half life aged incredibly well. I finished that game without needing walkthroughs, other than a glitched section with the missile selector and I loved it.\n\nHonestly I was surprised by how well it held up. Pacing, movement, environmental story. It is absolutely a game you can just hop into and enjoy in 2020. \n\nHaving loved Half Life I decided to play Opposing Force since people really seemed to be fond of it. I played and finished Opposing Force on the Hardest difficulty and completed the entire game in just under 4 hours according to Steam. Although I like to explore all parts of the gameworld so if you are going through then I could see it being finished in under 3 hours for the average gamer.\n\nI really have to say, Opposing Force is definitely the worst Half Life game I\u2019ve played and in general one of the worst non-indie games I\u2019ve played.\n\nFirst big issue I have with the game is the pacing and levels. It feels like an Alien tried to recreate Half Life from memory. There isn\u2019t really the set up of puzzles and other exploration like there was in Half Life, and a lot of the puzzles really amount to using the grappling hook on a super obvious green spot because those are the only things the grappling hook can grab onto. Or flipping a switch, or something very basic. Never really had the Eureka moment when playing.\n\nThere is definitely more combat and less hidden areas. A lot of it really feels like combat and then loads of ammo and healing. It's very stop-start rather than a consistent drip of resources. It just feels very very sloppy. I\u2019m not saying chapters like \u201cResidue Processing\u201d were what made Half Life 1 great, but the flow of the game, puzzles, and resource supply were really magical. It was easy to sit down and just play through the game. \n\nCombat in Opposing Force is really bad. Black ops soldiers take multiple alt-fire shotgun blasts to the head at point blank range to go down. Hit Scanners deal tons of damage so you need to be far enough to take advantage of spread or exploit AI. If you run or stand in the open you die in a few seconds so it\u2019s not really a run and gun, more like use corners to confuse the really bad AI. Some of that is true of Half Life 1 but the level design is so much more complex so a lot of the combat felt more puzzle like and had more options, generally. Half Life combat was never that great, so having a campaign focus on it which removes a lot of the things that supported Half Life combat is pretty bad.\n\nI don\u2019t think I remember the enemies in Half Life 1 being this spongy or having their AI be this bad. It really just feels awful to be shooting something for like 10 seconds straight just to not kill it. Almost all guns are horribly inaccurate which really makes them mesh together. The shotgun feels weak, the AR feels weak. Everything feels weak and unfun to use except explosives, portal gun, and the sniper rifle. The machine gun is OK, it deals more damage than other guns but is inaccurate and I found it more useful for increasing movement speed backwards than actually shooting people most of the time. It\u2019s a lot more effective to run past enemies than fight them and actually not that hard to do.\n\n\nThey added a bunch of alien weapons but none of them are really interesting. A projectile gun that doesn\u2019t need ammo. It\u2019s like the Hivehand but worse and less cool looking. The spore launcher is a ranged explosive that bounces a bit. I don\u2019t know why they added it in a game with a rocket launcher and grenade launcher. We don\u2019t get the extremely distinct and separate feel that we did with the original Half Life. I mean just consider that line up, the Gluon gun was way different from the crossbow, which could be used underwater, which was way different from the MP5. \n\nProbably the only interesting gun they added was the portal gun. It shoots giant powerful blasts and the alternate fire takes you to Zen to gather resources. Each location on the map has different Zen levels associated with the alternate fire which is pretty neat.\n\n\n\n\nThere are these squad mechanics but they are a joke. Squadmates are really more cannon fodder and they can deal friendly fire which killed me a few times. Enemies still seem to focus on you and their following AI is borderline non-functional. You also can\u2019t seem to carry them across the loading screens almost all the time. Generally I just killed them for ammo if I needed it. But sometimes the game will make you fail the mission for killing them because they were needed for scripted events.\n\n\nThe final boss fight uses Goldsource ladders and ropes. Lol it\u2019s horrible. I have no idea what they were thinking when they made this. Horrendous design decisions and really just unenjoyable to play. The goldsource is janky when it comes to movements but jumping around in open spaces can be pretty fun. But all the confined spaces and use of ladders is honestly pathetic. It\u2019s really bad.\n\nAlso the game is extremely buggy. I didn\u2019t use a walkthrough for this one but I noticed doors grinded and would not open no matter what. I looked up \u201cdoor grinding opposing force\u201d and of course it\u2019s a thing. Doors just get stuck and prohibit progress. This happened to me 3 times with essential doors. Sometimes launching an explosive or jumping at it while mashing the use key works. \n\nI\u2019ve also had save files corrupt. I\u2019ve gotten stuck between level changes, a LOT. Especially a level change with a lift or vent I got stuck and had to keep loading autosaves to try to prevent it. For the vent ones try to be running at top speed before loading for the lifts try to jump before it hits the ground. I know Gearbox is infamous for making broken games, especially their horrific Halo port, but damn it\u2019s like no one actually played this game before shipping it. But I guess I was able to finish it without using the console or anything.\n\nThis game does absolutely nothing better than Vanilla Half Life, actually it does everything worse. I would not suggest paying money for it or spending time to play it. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t learn anything from the original Half Life release.", "timestamp_created": 1606068355, "timestamp_updated": 1606068355, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79657529": {"recommendationid": "79657529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016142506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 474, "last_played": 1603790789}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has aged very badly", "timestamp_created": 1606049148, "timestamp_updated": 1606049148, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439247012138366699", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79560971": {"recommendationid": "79560971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320777482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 375, "last_played": 1609763163}, "language": "german", "review": "I played this game out of interest in games history and I pretty much got, what I deserved: An old game, that also unfortunately shows its age.

Don't even get me started on the fucking pit drones.\nI played through the campaign in both hard and easy difficulty, and there was absolutely no difference.\n\nThe Vortigaunts are placed in ways to ambush the player, but the problem is that they typically damage you when there is nothing you can do about it, since they are either placed in hard-to-kill spots, or you have no ammunition left. There is also a severe lack in medkits during these sections, requiring sv_cheats 1 if you save in a bad spot.\n\nI also had to noclip out of certain floors or walls, because the game is so fucking bad that it lets you get stuck in them.\n\nThe final boss was underwhelming as well, and violated the basic rule of the Half-Life series: show a way that you can beat your enemies.\nI was stuck on it for a while because HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW TO SHOOT THE GODDAMN PURPLE BALL?\nThroughout the early days of the Half-Life series, balls of energy have been shown to teleport, so I thought that I would have to go in the ball. The game didn't let me.\nThen I realized you could shoot out the eyeballs of the alien. Thought that if you shot them out enough times, it would kill it. After about 10 times of shooting out the eyeballs with no change, I realized this wasn't it.\n\nThe weapons are also unbalanced. Some guns are weaker than a peashooter, while others are stupidly good. In the end, it doesn't even matter, since you won't have enough ammo to fire these guns in the first place.\n\nAlso, who decided to make the Black Ops tanks? You cannot kill them with a FULL SMG MAGAZINE. ON THE EASIEST DIFFICULTY.\n\nThat being said, this mod had its moments. During the times when it wasn't obscenely difficult, the campaign was loads of fun to play through. I only recommend this game to the die-hard Half-Life fans, since the only reason I slogged through the frustrating parts of the campaign was to say that I had beaten the whole Half-Life series.\n\nI might play through it another time and edit my review, but for now, I would rather play Hunt Down the Freeman.

But in the year 2020, it's one of, if not THE buggiest, glitch filled game I have ever played. It's got a lot of cool concepts and ideas to it and an awesome story, but it seems like it was coded in windows paint. Some people have the game work perfectly and love it, for me it's a barely functional mess. Yes I've verified the game cache...\n\nGearbox actually developed this for Valve and it shows by the lack of polish in my opinion. In their credit, they do a really good job of capturing the feel of Half Life 1, but they just cant do it as good... They capture the right feel of the puzzles and lay out, but it just feels sloppier somehow...\n\nYou have to quick save at least once a minute because something will constantly break and you'll just die or be stuck in place. I had to reload THE FIRST ROOM of the tutorial at least 4 times before it worked. That's not the only stuff that's broken.\n\nDOORS: You'll constantly find yourself slamming face first into a door that either doesn't open unless you walk away from it 2-3 times, OR you'll have to spam your activate key like it was a quicktime event. They also seem to break the Marines A.I, as they just have the worst time trying to figure out how to walk through one and follow you. \n\nTHE A.I: The A.I in the game is artificial for sure, but not intelligent... Most of the enemies are scripted sequences they they don't break tooo much. They'll spawn, stand in the same spot and let you shoot them. \nYour fellow Marines on the other hand make the nickname \"Crayon Eaters\" seem to distinguished. You have to keep telling them to keep following you every 5 feet because they forget almost instantly and just stand still. If you do manage to get them to follow you, get ready for a laugh. These poor lemmings will just run back and forth like a child with ADHD. They'll get trapped in doorways, trapped in huge rooms!. If you break eye contact with them they'll forget about you like a baby without object pertinence and just break. If they take the tiniest bit of damage from an explosion, hell if they even SEE an explosion, they yell \"Traitor!\", and gun you down. Sometimes they'll just break and start shooting you for no reason. Stay behind them because they don't care if your in the line of fire, you get in their way you're just another enemy...\n\nTHE DIFFICULTY: It is difficult but not because of the challenges you face, but because of how much this game doesn't want you to have resources. The game is SO stingy with ammo and health, but it'll throw 10 useless guns at you right at the very start. The true challenge of this game is to ever have full health and shields at the same time. There are tons of situations where the game forces you to take damage to progress. That or the sloppy controls just sent you careening into an electric fence or getting yourself stuck on something you're trying to jump over.\n\nTHE WEAPONS: It's doesn't really feel like Gearbox had a set sense of direction for this. What I mean is you get the pipe wrench as your first weapon, you think cool! Then no less then 20 secs later, you get a combat knife that makes it look like a wiffle ball bat. The pacing of the new weapons is just so off. Your first gun is the Magnum which kicks ass and is by far your best gun when it comes to a mix of range and damage. The next gun you get is the shotgun which is virtually worthless as with it's EXTREMELY LIMITED range and damage, you're honestly better off with a knife. So then after you get what are \"supposed\" to better guns you should be getting later, that's when you get the base pistol. The progression just feels so backwards and unfocused. By that time your current guns are way better comparatively.  Most of the weapons in this game are just gimmicky reskins of the ones in Half Life, with only really I believe, the M249 being a new introduction. \n\nI love Half Life and was super excited to play this, but it is just a nightmare to play with all of the bugs. It's not fun quickloading a sequence 5 times to get it to work. It's disappointing because you can see the potential for awesome fun, but get bogged down by so many technical errors. \n\nIf you love Half-Life, by all means buy it, but be prepared to go online to download some unoffical patches. That or have a lot of patience.\n                             \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1587397329, "timestamp_updated": 1587397329, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489653497934341431", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67478151": {"recommendationid": "67478151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182539811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 375, "last_played": 1587107275}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud558\ud504\ub77c\uc774\ud504 \ud32c\uc774\uc2dc\ub77c\uba74 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud574\ubcf4\uc138\uc694\n\ubbf8\uce5c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc640 \uadf8\uc9c0 \uac19\uc740 AI, \ubc84\uadf8\uc5d0 \uc790\uc2e0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74", "timestamp_created": 1587107333, "timestamp_updated": 1587107333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66993736": {"recommendationid": "66993736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035093176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1586482584}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't hear a thing over the unmutable MP3 music.

There are also interesting new weapon concepts. Also the boot camp tutorial is extremely well done, and it's probably the highlight of the game.\n\nUnfortunately for the expansion, all the new concepts are very poorly integrated. For example, climbable ropes appear maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire game. In another case, 2 new types of suit rechargers are teased in the tutorial, military and civilian, and I only saw the military recharger once (I didn't find a single civilian recharger).\n\nHealth and suit power pickups are very scarce, and you are often thrown into hordes of enemies. There's one section where you're in a pitch-black maze and are meant to face off against many miniboss-tier enemies, with no ammo or health pickups. On the very last level, you face off against hordes of black-ops, at which point i turned on noclip and godmode because I was tired of this.\n\nAt one point, multiple new weapons are introduced very close to each other, with little instructions on how to use them, so I finished the game with about 3 weapons I ended up never using. \n\nThese complaints are just a very small slice of annoyances I had with the expansion. However, I don't feel like writing, so I'll stop here.\n\nBlue shift is a much better expansion, go play that instead.", "timestamp_created": 1585331067, "timestamp_updated": 1590357360, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467839837074279785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65763736": {"recommendationid": "65763736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328177932", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1689082190}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043a\u0441 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1585119432, "timestamp_updated": 1655880998, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65714775": {"recommendationid": "65714775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119910278", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1585063164}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud55c\uae00\ud654\uac00 \ub418\uc5b4\uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \uc5d0\uc784\uc774 \ud55c\uacf3\uc5d0 \uace0\uc815 \ub418\uc5b4\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\uc2dc \ubc14\ub77c\ubcf4\ub294 \ud654\uba74 \uc678\uc5d0\ub294 \ubcfc \uc218\uac00 \uc5c6\ub124\uc694.", "timestamp_created": 1585063432, "timestamp_updated": 1585063432, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65468826": {"recommendationid": "65468826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064812988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1584792144}, "language": "czech", "review": "Pamatuji si na tuto hru, jak jsme ji  klukama pa\u0159ili  v \"pir\u00e1tsk\u00e9 edici\" na domac\u00ed LANce.

this is going to get me hate, I get it, we're all Half-Life fans here, but please, hear me out on this one, I have a lot of bases to cover.\nTo start off, let's just do a quick pros and cons for Opposing Force:\nPros:\nNew, completely original soundtrack by Chris Jensen\nCampaign that is longer than the original Half-Life's\nNew weapons, characters, enemies, and multiplayer gamemodes to explore\nCons:\ngameplay seems incredibly unbalanced in some areas\ncool concepts (the xen portal gun) are left relatively unexplored\nBugs, a LOT of bugs.\n\nThis brings me to the main reason why I am not recommending Opposing Force right now. The game has unfortunately aged abysmally. Originally, I had thought that my issues were coming from the fact that I was playing on Hard mode. Lord knows \"Hard\" meant something different in the 90s than it does now, but the further in I went, the more I realized that it wasn't me, it was the game. Weapons that I had picked up and appeared in my hotbar failed to actually register as weapons I had. This was a major problem for several portions of the game, as my rocket launcher, xen portal gun, and machine gun were all effectively missing from my inventory despite the fact that I had them and ammo for them. The second major issue I had was an unavoidable crash near the end of the game. In the parking garage, I would crash every single time I attempted to turn a corner down a ramp, effectively forcing me to use cheats just to finish the game.\nNext off, the gameplay itself, while being Half-Lifey, is honestly broken in its own right. Enemies appear to be able to damage the player more than the player can damage them with the same weapon when playing on Hard mode. I know I'm going to be told to just \"get good\" over this, but a fundamental element of singleplayer, story driven games is that the player feels like their in control. Sure, for things like giant aliens, I can see the reasoning behind why I'm not stronger than them, but Adrian Shephard isn't supposed to be a regular soldier, either, he's supposed to be a Corporal that's equipped with a new, experimental suit of armor akin to the soldier version of the HEV suit. Attacks from Shock Troopers take a minimum of 10 hp off Adrian if he doesn't have any suit power, and believe me, suit power is few and far between in this game. Things like the rope gameplay and use of a night vision instead of flashlight seem arbitrary and unnecessary to me. The rope gameplay itself seems to fail to do its job properly in every place it's in during gameplay, especially during the final boss. Night Vision, on the other hand, is weak and doesn't go out far enough for the player to see in some dark areas of the game where it's an absolute necessity.\n\n\n[h1] SPOILERS FOR THE STORY BELOW [/h1] \n\nOpposing Force sees you as Corporal Adrian Shephard, an HECU Commander equipped with an experimental Military vest called the \"PCV\" or \"Powered Combat Vest.\" Shephard and his squad are brought in early on during the Black Mesa incident, but Shephard is knocked out after their heli crashes. Because of this, you witness the end of Half-Life early on in the campaign, and see what happens after Gordon has already defeated the Nihilinth afterwards. After initial containment by the HECU is deemed a failure, the black ops are brought in to take out everyone through the use of a warhead. Shephard disarms the warhead, but it later detonates after the end of the game anyway. After fighting through hoards of Race X aliens and Black ops, Shephard finds himself in the depths of the industrial section of Black Mesa. Here, he encounters the Gene Worm, a giant Race X alien capable of processing and converting the entire planet into a habitat fit for Race X. Shephard kills it and is captured by the Gman, who keeps him in stasis, leaving the player to wonder what might happen to him next.\n\nThe story and gameplay tell a very different tale than that of Half-Life. You're not a super scientist saving the world in a big orange suit, you're a soldier on the losing side of a war fighting desperately to survive, knowing that the only way to win is to sacrifice Black Mesa and everyone in it. Opposing Force feels a lot like the Halo Reach of Half-Life. You don't feel anywhere near as Strong as Gordon Freeman, and you have to abandon and sacrifice your own squad members throughout the campaign just to keep going. With Opposing Force starting near the end of Half-Life, you can get a proper perspective of what's going on with the invasion outside of Gordon Freeman's point of view, and just how much damage is being dealt to the whole world. By the time you're fighting the gene worm, you don't feel like a hero, you feel like a tired soldier moments away from falling apart, just wanting it all to be over with. When the game ends, after the credit sequence, you aren't booted out into the main menu, you're given a black screen with the low whistling of wind, continuing on into eternity. The game's story is poetic, it puts you in the shoes of a member of the bad guys suffering the same fate as the good guys, and ends with an immense loss, especially considering what happens to humanity next. One can argue that Gordon Freeman's battle in Half-Life is the same, struggling to fight the oncoming invasion and somewhat losing at the end, but in Half-Life, you know what you did saved the world from the Xen invasion, whereas in Opposing Force, you don't have any orders being given to you by scientists or commanders, you're a lost soldier just doing what he can do to survive.\n\nSTORY SPOILERS END HERE.\n\nWith a story like that, usually I could give a raving 5 star review, but the gameplay is just too broken in the modern day for me to grace it with such. I would say \"I hope Valve or Gearbox go back to fix these\" but we both know they won't. It's 2020. With all that said and done, though, here's to Half-Life Alyx coming out in just a few days, and here's to Tripmine Studios for their Operation: Black Mesa and Guard Duty mods that they're developing!\n\n[h1] DECEMBER 2020 UPDATE [/h1]\nYeah the game's still shit. I was genuinely glad when it finally crashed on me again so I could have a good excuse to stop playing. Wait for Operation: Black Mesa to come out or get it as part of the Valve complete pack. Don't get Op Force on its own, it's not worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1584315992, "timestamp_updated": 1609234393, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484853297472000122", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65110005": {"recommendationid": "65110005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328899443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1641837368}, "language": "german", "review": "wenn man die sich drehen will geht es nicht", "timestamp_created": 1584304659, "timestamp_updated": 1584304659, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65102119": {"recommendationid": "65102119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258050981", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1584294714}, "language": "polish", "review": "za duzo przeczywiniow nie wiem jak ponac ostatniego bosa", "timestamp_created": 1584294761, "timestamp_updated": 1584294761, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65096748": {"recommendationid": "65096748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077269017", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1584735972}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041a\u0410\u041b", "timestamp_created": 1584288434, "timestamp_updated": 1584288434, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64967125": {"recommendationid": "64967125", "author": {"steamid": "76561199008426396", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1583743679}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0438\u0433\u043d\u044f \u0441 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439", "timestamp_created": 1584110457, "timestamp_updated": 1584110457, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444444447755813599", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64908673": {"recommendationid": "64908673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168837430", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1584013224}, "language": "english", "review": "This game would be nice to play directly after \"half life\" but it is very buggy.

Why? At first, I had a mouse bug which didn't allow me to move my camera, you have to mark the checkbox \"raw mouse input\" in the Mouse settings tab to fix it. There were other bugs, but luckily nothing critical.\n\nThe idea of a new perspective and new weapons seemed pretty cool, but the game spends too much time having you solving easy but drawn-out puzzles and run around boring enclosed environments rather than fight against aggressive enemies. Eventually, it gets there, but almost at the end and unbalanced as hell. The new weapons are nice, but you barely get ammo for them and, once again, by the time you do the game is almost over. I sure enjoyed the custom training levels, those were pretty fun.\n\nLet's talk about the story, how is it? A Half-Life expansion where you play as a HECU soldier? That sure sounds promising but it resulted to be generic and little creative. In resume, we the \"bad guys\", whose order is capture Freeman and kill the witnesses, end having to leave the base just as in the original. But now instead of HECU soldiers, we have other soldiers called \"Black Ops\" trying to kill us for being also considered witnesses? I checked out some other reviews and saw some people consider this to be as good as the original. In my opinion, It's not even near.\n\nAnother thing that annoyed me, the game is translated to Korean but not Spanish? One of the most spoken languages in the world. Really? I mean, Valve... you had over 15 years to do it. There are community translations, but it's not their job, it's yours.\n\nIf I had to pick between Blue Shift and this expansion, Blue Shift was more enjoyable. If you gonna play it, do yourself a favor and play this game after recently finishing the original Half-Life as I did. All the experience and familiarity from HL will help a lot since they re-used a lot of level ideas from it, lack of creativity I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1556150203, "timestamp_updated":

In general you probably don\u2019t think of anything good, but did you know that Gearbox\u2019s first projects were [i]Half-Life[/i] expansions [i]Opposing Force[/i] and [i]Blue Shift[/i]? Probably not, since neither of them were very noteworthy or good. [i]Opposing Force[/i] was pretty clearly the one that all the time and money was pumped into. We play as Corporal Adrian Shephard of the HECU, an antagonistic U.S. military unit from the base game sent into Black Mesa to kill all the witnesses to the resonance cascade and subsequent alien invasion. [i]Opposing Force[/i] conveniently dodges making Shephard an actual baddie by having his helicopter crash on the way to Black Mesa. As such we wake up after being brought to safety by a group of scientists and have to fight our way out of the facility. Along the way we fight assorted enemies including the aliens from the base game, a couple of aliens not from the base game, and the black ops unit from the first game. We\u2019re given an assortment of different weapons including a sniper rifle, machine gun, and a handheld version of the barnacle enemy complete with gross, long tongue!\n\nYou may even use some of these new weapons, but the easiest way to win is to stick with the basic pistol, which features a laser sight and is so absurdly powerful that there\u2019s really no reason to use any of the cool alien guns you\u2019re stocked up with over the game\u2019s runtime. The most fun I had with [i]Opposing Force[/i] was swinging on the janky barnacle tongue, which was great when it didn\u2019t bug out and kill me. The game has some very large areas compared to the base game, but unless you\u2019re playing this in 1999 there\u2019s nothing especially impressive going on here. [i]Opposing Force[/i]\u2019s real issue is that it has new weapons and levels, but no new ideas. Nothing as original or exciting as what was on display in the original [i]Half-Life[/i] is present here, and taking place concurrently with the base game just means it\u2019s treading water narratively as well as mechanically. The point is I went in with tempered expectations (I knew that this came out almost 20 years ago and that Gearbox made it), but was still disappointed. The temptation to play this expansions out of love for [i]Half-Life[/i] is a common one, and I cannot recommend strongly enough that you disregard it and just go outside instead.",

This one just feels lazy, the obvious solution sometimes isn't even the solution at all. I had a situation where I met a dead end with a vent I couldn't reach and a window leading to a fall that would easily kill me, there wasn't anything I could move or climb to get to the vent so after a few minutes I smashed the window out of frustration and jumped out to- what I thought would be my death only to find a small ledge beneath me that was impossible to see before. A few rooms down I come across a similar problem and bam. Indestructible window. What you're supposed to do is shove your hand up a barnacle's arse and swing across a chasm spiderman style. That is not a joke.\n\nHealth/ammo supplies are so low I thought the game was kidding. The new enemies are crack shots and don't feel like the running breathing shooting living AI that you'd find in Half-Life. And they are practically stuffed into levels at an absurd amount to the point that progressing is a brutal slog rife with save-scumming, a constant war of attrition where every hit you take feels like an instant failure, not even in an intense way. Just frustrating.\n\nStory starts off ok, seeing the story from the perspective of the HECU was a logical next step for HL. The first few minutes capture the chaos of the original game pretty well, the Black Mesa scientists attempting to save the protagonist and his team not even knowing they were sent there to kill just about everything in Black Mesa was pretty cool. The story stops there though, you spend the rest of the game just running along until the G-man lets you know when you won it.\n\nIt feels weird to say there were too many weapons in a thing, but there are. 16 weapons. In the last leg of the game you must get a good three of them and not a whole lot of time to figure out what they do. By the end of it I spent more time fighting the weapon select than I did any actual aliens, and who needs two melee weapons?\n\nFriendly AI is just as bad as it's always been, don't really want to follow you very much, get stuck a lot and killed more. The fact that they're a gimmick this time though made their flaws a lot more noticeable. I stopped bothering with them really quickly.\n\nThe final boss is laughably bad, I thought it was just blocking the door to the final boss until halfway through the fight. You just run around the same room over and over and shoot mounted guns at a thing until it dies. \n\nUnless you want the bragging rights of beating every Half-Life game (which I did) I wouldn't really

It allows you to witness the events of the first game through the eyes of Corporal Shephard, one of the marines who were sent to hunt down Gordon Freeman. It provides you with more weapons than the original game, including (but not only): a sniper rifle, an improved pistol, a grappling gun and a teleportation gun. The enemies you face are: black ops (including those pesky, superfast sniper girls) and the aliens (both new and old ones). [b]Opposing Force[/b] also introduces some new mechanics like: rope climbing and squad control. There is only a few times when you can use your squad members, but when you can, they provide assisstance in firefights, can cut through metal doors and heal you. Note: however, unlike Freeman, Shephard can't use the long jump module.\n\n[b]Opposing Force[/b] had the potential to be a great expansion to a great game, but imo it's inferior to the original game in every aspect. It adds little to the original story, has confusing level design, boring and/or unintuitive puzzles and unbalanced enemies. [b]HF:OF[/b] relies heavily on surprise attacks and, it seems, that trial and error was the intended way to progress through this game. At times, there's too much platforming and not enough shooting. But when the shooting is there, it's against nearly impossible odds.\n\n[b]HF:OF[/b] is nowhere near the smooth, gradual and intuitive experience the original game provided. That's why I can't recommend it. Unless you want to cheat through this game for the tiny bits of extra story that it provides OR really enjoy punishing hardcore shooters, just skip to [b]HF2[/b].\n\n[b]My overall rating:[/b]

GAME!!!!\nEl motivo que le d\u00e9 un \u201cNo recomendado\u201d, es simplemente porque el juego no incluye el lenguaje espa\u00f1ol, ni logros e cromos Steam.\nEs una verdadera verg\u00fcenza por parte de Valve, que no incluya el castellano en el juego, con el tiempo que ha tenido y los millones de Euros que gana, para haber empleado algo, para arreglarlo.\nTras haberme dejado el dinero en comprar este juego, he tenido que recurrir a un parche pirata, para ponerlo en mi idioma. Un parche, que no ayuda mucho, ya que el sonido no est\u00e1 remasterizado, y hace, que en ocasiones, el audio de las conversaciones de los personajes, se acople con el sonido ambiental, y no se entienda un carajo de lo que hablan.\nOs deber\u00eda caer la cara de verg\u00fcenza, por tratar a la comunidad hispana, como clientes de segunda categor\u00eda.\nMi an\u00e1lisis sobre el juego, es bastante positiva (dejando a un lado el problema del idioma del juego). La historia y su evoluci\u00f3n resulta bastante atractiva, comienzas viendo zonas de acci\u00f3n, a zonas con puzles a resolver, a lugares de terror.\nHay presente una nueva variedad de armas, de lo m\u00e1s atractiva, al igual que los enemigos a los que tienes que enfrentarte.\nLos puzles y los enemigos, tienen un nivel aceptable, haciendo que te lleves alguna sorpresa, de ver alg\u00fan \u201cmalo\u201d haciendo algo fuera de lo habitual, y poniendo las cosas dif\u00edciles para eliminarlo.\nLa utilizaci\u00f3n de los compa\u00f1eros soldados, esta poco evolucionada, ya que mueren muy deprisa al no poder recomendarles t\u00e1cticas. Hay que tener cuidado que no mueran a veces, ya que uno de ellos, puede ser la clave, para que puedas avanzar en el juego. Como por ejemplo, que se encargue de abrirte una puerta.\nSi juegas al videojuego, te sugiero que leas estos consejos:\n\n1)\tLa pistola reglamentaria del personaje (la que tiene puntero laser), guarda su munici\u00f3n como oro en pa\u00f1o. Ya que es un arma letal contra extraterrestres muy resistentes o los soldados de negro. La munici\u00f3n de esta arma, escasea bastante.\n\n2)\tGuarda la munici\u00f3n del rifle francotirador, para los monstruos m\u00e1s resistentes o soldados negros, ya que un disparo a distancia en la cabeza o el ojo (seg\u00fan el enemigo), los elimina al instante. Tambi\u00e9n hay muy poca munici\u00f3n de esta arma.\n\n3)\tCuando tengas la pistola de portales, te percataras que apretando el bot\u00f3n derecho, esta te teletransporta a la dimensi\u00f3n extraterrestre, para que puedas coger \u00edtems. Pues cuando encuentres bater\u00eda de carga para la pistola de portales, teletransportate al mundo alien\u00edgena y cuando regreses a tu mundo, volver\u00e1s al lugar donde est\u00e1n las bater\u00edas. En otras palabras, las bater\u00edas te indican siempre que es un lugar de regreso tras salir del mundo alien\u00edgena.\nPor cierto, los alien\u00edgenas que te encuentras en el otro mundo, al usar la pistola de portales, no son peligrosos, as\u00ed que no les ataques o te atacaran.\nLa pistola de portales, es un arma muy potente, para deshacerte de enemigos fuertes (a excepci\u00f3n de Jefes).\n\n4)\tEl jefe final es f\u00e1cil de vencer. Disparas con las dos pistolas l\u00e1seres a sus ojos, y luego vas enfrente al agujero de su panza y te pones a disparar a su interior. Repite el proceso varias veces y lo eliminaras. No te olvides de esquivar sus ataques.\n\nTienes que saber, que el juego \u201cHalf-Life Opposing Force\u201d, es una ampliaci\u00f3n de la historia de Half Life 1 (Half Life, Half-Life Source o Black Mesa). No es necesario, tener en tu cuenta Steam el Half Life, para que puedas jugar al Half-Life Opposing Force.\n\nSolo c\u00f3mpralo, si te encuentras el Valve Complete Pack, por menos de 15\u20ac.\n\nSi Valve se digna a poner el resto de idiomas europeos remasterizados (Espa\u00f1ol), logros y cromos Steam en el videojuego, prometo recomendar el videojuego.", "timestamp_created": 1517681095, "timestamp_updated": 1539384313, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492673426866531372", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39756315": {"recommendationid": "39756315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096560502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 135, "last_played": 1534971892}, "language": "english", "review": "My camera is glitching out, please fix this!", "timestamp_created": 1517435730, "timestamp_updated": 1517435730, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39515772": {"recommendationid": "39515772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261265924", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1500467554}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 : 1.3\uc2dc\uac04\n\n\ud3c9\uac00 : ???", "timestamp_created": 1516554750, "timestamp_updated": 1616909134, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39290961": {"recommendationid": "39290961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269505968", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1500243648}, "language": "english", "review": "Abim s\u00fcrekli bu i\u011fren\u00e7 oyunu oynad\u0131\u011f\u0131 i\u00e7in ne lol oynayabiliyorum ne de cesego.

You'll get on an elevator, activate it, and the elevator simply won't move because your body has frozen in place and is stopping it from being able to, y'know, BE AN ELEVATOR.\nAnother is where you'll die randomly when activating certain machinery, such as the Star-Wars; A New Hope garbage compactor rip off, where upon activating it, if you try to move, you will just...Die. Out of the blue. \n\nThe lore as well, is an absolute insult to the Half-Life series. While Half-Life: Blueshift kept promise and stayed true to the series (But was disappointingly short), Opposing Force chooses to just throw in another batch of aliens into the mix. They are used as both the main 'Opposing force' to Opposing Force. The normal Xen aliens were practically thrown out the window, and are seldom used after the first few chapters (Minus headcrabs, Zombies and five Vortigaunts). \n\nYou'd believe that these new enemies would include the Black Mesa personnel that are terrified of being butchered by highly trained Marines who have difficulty spelling, right?\n\nNope.\n\nThe game has ALL of the facility staff that you meet as friendly as possible, all practically running around naked, and none of the scientists even bothering to wear a Hazardous Environment Suit (Which must have been very well available due to how many bodies of dead HEV Scientists you find within Xen) and attempting to fight you and your men. \n\nWhat could you possibly replace the HECU with as the main human enemy within this horrid game?\nBlack Ops.\nYou read that right.\nBlack ops.\n\nWhen originally, the Black Ops had only females whose relations with the HECU were unknown; Male Black Ops were added, practically being HECU that attack the HECU. Do they work as an Antagonist? Yes, they do, very well. However it simply doesn't make sense.\n\nThe HECU are advanced trained Marines that were sent into Black Mesa as a cleanup crew; The fact that they thought that  once a group as experienced as the HECU were unable to complete their job, that instead of just sending in another HECU Team to plant a nuke and extract, that they send in Black Ops to eliminate every NON-EXTRACTED HECU within Black Mesa, alongside all scientists, security officers and Aliens (Mind you, who ultimately fail at even successfully activating the bomb without the Gmans interference) is just retarded.\n\nAll in all;\nIt's a 'fun' action game with frustrating glitches and a horribly written story.

Every highlight of the game is just something you saw in the original. The value of this game is nostalgia, nothing more.\n\nEvery step of the way, you can both see and feel when valve employees said to gearbox developers \"oh yeah and its gotta have this part here...  and honestly just model this part after this... you haven't put any of THIS in! Where is THIS?!?!\"\n\nE.g. they stole the bit where you have to jump across a chasm to reach a ladder, and they ripped off the canyon jumping sequence, and the pit worm (spoiler lol) is modeled after the 3 headed beast in blast pit... you get the idea.\n\nYou know how the Angry Video Game Nerd talks about video game publishing contractors (e.g. LJN)?\n\nThat's how i'd describe gearbox while putting out this \"gem\"\n\nEvery aspect of gameplay that feels even slightly good is offset completely by remembering how much better it was in the original Half-Life. Valve should NOT let their genius be ripped off by charlatans like gearbox.\n\nThere are some neat new weapons but for every cool weapon added you have 1 cooler weapon from half-life that didn't happen to make it in and 4 game segments that feel cheesy, like there was minimal effort put into it.\n\nIt is very easy to imagine this was coded, textured, etc. by about 15 people who spent about 300 man hours between them working on this while being completely focused on something else.\n\nSurprisingly, however, the game has fewer glitches than half life. However, it retains the worst glitch of half-life, where you are in a small enclosed space, crouched, and the map changes (and you subsequently get stuck in the floor) meaning that you have to jump a while in the enclosed space, hoping that you happen to be in the air when changing between maps.\n\nIf you're not out to complete every half life game then this game is not worth it\n\ndo not buy\n\nmultiplayer is abandoned (Half life 1's multiplayer deathmatch isn't, though. Just saying.) so if you want to play that you'll need to arrange for a lan party or something", "timestamp_created": 1486342522, "timestamp_updated": 1486342522, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.26284414529800415", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29701146": {"recommendationid": "29701146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058345936", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1579654663}, "language": "english", "review": "You don't partake in the massacre of the Black Mesa personnel.", "timestamp_created": 1486236574, "timestamp_updated": 1486236574, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534200191497802734", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29109073": {"recommendationid": "29109073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316456488", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1535462885}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0433\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0445\u0430\u043b\u0444\u043b\u0430\u0439\u0444 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043c\u044b \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044b\u044e \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e! \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0443 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u044b \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0434\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0438(\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432) \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043f\u043f\u0446!!!! \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0430\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e!!!!! \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439!!!! \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u044b\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1483859424, "timestamp_updated": 1489999043, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.246740788221359253", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29060014": {"recommendationid": "29060014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097864954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1475349063}, "language": "english", "review": "If your playing this because you liked the original half life, that's fine, but this game has a very diferent aesthetic that drove me away.", "timestamp_created": 1483709726, "timestamp_updated": 1483709726, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.392169356346130371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29004646": {"recommendationid": "29004646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040042062", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1483563333}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]M\u00e1s all\u00e1 del nombre este juego no tiene el menor parentesco con el Half-Life original.

One of the alien guns actually have an animation that show the protagonist \"petting\" the creature. Very nice.\n[*]During some moments in the game it will interwine with Gordon Freeman's adventure, and you'll be able to see dialogue from the original or even Gordon Freeman himself from a new PoV.\n[*]There is no Surface Tension-like chapter in this one which is an absolute plus in anything related to Half-Life.\n[*]The Training Camp chapter is hilarious and a joy to play.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]Many of the new weapons and enemies are re-hashes of Half-Life weapons and enemies.\n[*]Some areas feel like a completely different game, pushing my suspension of disbelief that Gordon Freeman never saw the new alien race or the unbelievably differently designed areas of Black Mesa in the original Half-Life (is Black Mesa racist and only let the black guards work in one department?)\n[*]The goddamn fucking green filter night vision is blinding!\n[*]The game quickly abandons most of its \"soldier\" premise after the main team leaves and the rest of the gameplay is mostly a watered down version of Half-Life, with a few new uses of the soldier mechanics here and there.\n[*]The store page advertises this game like we play as one of the soldiers ordered to murder Gordon Freeman, yet we're never really ordered to do so, as the game already starts close to the \"Forget About Freeman\" chapter of the original Half-Life. You barely even see Freeman through the game.\n[*]Like in the original, some of the puzzles are downright impossible without a walkthrough.\n[*]Like in the original, it's artificially extended, with some badly designed chapters that have no reason to exist in the middle of the actual interesting chapters.\n[*]The multiplayer barely works most of the time, and is generally dominated by professionals.\n[*]Disappointing cliffhanger-like ending, that will most likely never get anywhere.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nIt's still a fun game most of the time but significantly flawed and by the end of it, it's already a chore to play.

I think my total is two complete playthroughs and two abandoned halfway through.\n\nMy opinion from the start has been one of sharp dichotomy - the first half of Opposing Force is probably my favorite part of the entire Black Mesa Incident that makes up the original Half-Life and its spinoffs, while the second half is easily my least favorite. It took me a while, but I finally pinned down exactly where it all went wrong: right after the Pit Worm.\n\nIt starts showing warning signs earlier than that, in the alien \"zoo\" where sudden the game is a showcase of awkward alien \"weapons\" which mostly involve sticking your hand up some interdimensional bug's ass and squeezing its prostate until something happens, but after the Pit Worm the game basically dumps all sense of balance and is just a tedious slog of high-powered enemies, limited resources, and uncomfortable terrain until the final boss just sort of \"happens\" and the game ends.\n\nOne of the more unusual sources of difficult that this game has is actually too many weapons. Most people who are familiar with the pre-Halo standards of FPS design are fairly used to carrying around 10 weapons with no thought to where you're actually stashing them all, but Opposing Force isn't satisfied by a \"mere\" ten ways of violently resolving problems. It needs 17. This actually proves to be more disruptive than helpful, as not only is it hard to keep every single one of these weapons properly stocked with ammunition, but switching between them in the heat of combat actually becomes part of the challenge as you try to rapidly scroll through the weapons bar for a more situationally appropriate weapon while under fire.\n\nOther nitpicks don't really stand out amidst the standards of the Half-Life games, like the breathtakingly stupid companion AI who will lose track of you if you move at a brisk pace more than ten feet away. They're at least slightly more useful here, with a medic who can actually fight, soldiers with something bigger than a rent-a-cop's pea shooter, and so on. Doesn't stop them from being mowed down in seconds by Black Ops ninjas, but it's something.\n\nUltimately though, the awful second half of the game overshadows any merits its early levels might have, so just give it a miss and play the other two instead.", "timestamp_created": 1411687825, "timestamp_updated": 1496857030, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497361302375793457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12193005": {"recommendationid": "12193005", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961218220", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 989, "last_played": 1610433531}, "language": "english", "review": "Id' like to address you personally Gabe Newell, yes im talking to you.
