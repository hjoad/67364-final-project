The model predicted 783 positive instances (true positives [1,1]). The model predicted 770 negative instances (true negatives [0,0]), 198 incorrect predictions at the top right (false positives [0,1]) and 249 incorrect predictions of positive instances (false negatives [1,0]). From these observations, we can see that the model has a balanced prediction ability."
