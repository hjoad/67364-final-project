The model predicted 783 positive instances (true positives [1,1]). The model predicted 770 negative instances (true negatives [0,0]), 198 incorrect predictions at the top right (false positives [0,1]) and 249 incorrect predictions of positive instances (false negatives [1,0]). From these observations, we can see that the model has a balanced prediction ability."

    "As you can see from the precision-recall curve, the model is classifying the true positives, the precision is communicating how accurate the model's predictions are and recall tells us the true positives. The curve depicts that the model is keeping the recall low by being extremely picky. In addition, the precision is high. However, it tries to catch as many positives as possible and increasing the recall. This is not good because the model is more prone to making mistakes and the precision will go down. The model is essentially keeping it fair between obtaining all positives and maintaining precision. "
